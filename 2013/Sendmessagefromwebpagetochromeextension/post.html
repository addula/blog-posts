<p>I just answer on that question in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18374252/how-do-i-pass-back-data-from-a-remote-window-to-a-chrome-extensions-background/18377748#18377748">StackOverflow</a>. I think that this is a common quetion so it worths writing about it. </p>[STOP]

<p>The idea is use the content script as a bridge between your web page and the background script. Let's get the following code put in the background:</p>

<pre><code>chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(message, sender, sendResponse) {
    alert("message received");
});

chrome.windows.create({
    type : 'popup',
    url : "http://yoursite.com/page.html",
    type: "popup"
}, function(newWindow) {

});
</code></pre>

<p>The first part of the snippet actually waits for a message coming from the content script. That's the place where you will be notified that something occur inside your web page. The second part creates a new window which loads the given url. (You may skip that. I added it in the article just because the question in stackoverflow contains it.)</p>

<p>In your web page you have to dispatch an event by using the <em>document</em> object:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    var go = function() {
        var event = document.createEvent('Event');
        event.initEvent('hello');
        document.dispatchEvent(event);
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;a href="javascript:go();"&gt;Click me&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And at the end your content script should contain:</p>

<pre><code>document.addEventListener("hello", function(data) {
    chrome.runtime.sendMessage("test");
});
</code></pre>

<p>You just catch the event send from the page and send another one to the background script.</p>
