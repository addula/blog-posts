<p>I'm currently working on OrganicCSS - a micro framework based on <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic CSS</a> concept. I'm thinking a lot for name conventions, classes and of course mixins. I decided to combine three mixins in a file called <em>_box-model.scss</em>. They will provide a shortcuts for margin, padding and border properties.</p>[STOP]

<p>That's what I start from:</p>

<pre><code>@mixin margin($values...) {
    margin: $values;
}
@mixin padding($values...) {
    padding: $values;
}
@mixin border($values...) {
    border: $values;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I could say that for margin and padding such kind of mixin is good enough. However the border once is not flexible at all. That's because very often I set only <em>border-top</em> property. So, instead of that I decided to pass four parameters and transform the code to</p>

<pre><code>@mixin border($top, $right, $bottom, $left) {
    border-top: $top;
    border-right: $right;
    border-bottom: $bottom;
    border-left: $left;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But now it requires four arguments to be passed. That's not good, because I'll have to write more, which is exactly the opposite of what I was trying to achieve. Thankfully <a href="http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/search?search_for=sass">SASS</a> offers default values for the mixin's parameters and this helps a lot.</p>

<pre><code>@mixin border($top: none, $right: none, $bottom: none, $left: none) {
    border-top: $top;
    border-right: $right;
    border-bottom: $bottom;
    border-left: $left;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, the mixin changes several times and I simply wrote a short list of requirements, which I wanted to accomplish:</p>

<ul>
<li>should accept no arguments</li>
<li>should reset the property</li>
<li>should support applying value to only certain versions of the property (i.e. <em>border-left</em>, <em>border-right</em> etc ...)</li>
<li>it should be possible to pass only one parameter and apply it to all the versions sides</li>
</ul>

<p>A good check list, isn't it. The first one could be covered if I define default values for all the arguments. The second one is also doable if the defaults are properly set. And the fact that I have predefined values means that I'm able to send only the last property, so the third point could be also marked as done. The last one is a little bit tricky and require the usage of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#id10">@if directive</a>. Here is the final version:</p>

<pre><code>@mixin border($top: none, $right: none, $bottom: none, $left: none) {
    border-top: $top;
    @if $right == none {
        border-right: $top;
    } @else {
        border-right: $right;
    }
    @if $bottom == none {
        border-bottom: $top;
    } @else {
        border-bottom: $bottom;
    }
    @if $left == none {
        border-left: $top;
    } @else {
        border-left: $left;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I used the same concept for padding and margin mixins.</p>
