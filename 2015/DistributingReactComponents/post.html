<p>While I was open sourcing <a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-place">react-place</a> I noticed that there is some complexity around preparing the component for releasing. I decided to document the process here so I have a solid resource next time. You may be surprised but writing the working <code>jsx</code> file doesn&rsquo;t mean that the component is ready for publishing and is usable for other developers.</p>[STOP]
<h2 id="the-component"><a name="user-content-the-component" href="#the-component" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>The component</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-place">react-place</a> is a component that renders an input field. The user starts typing a city name and the component makes predictions/suggestions. The component accepts a property called <code>onLocationSet</code>. It is fired once the user selects some of the suggestions. The function receives an object containing short description and geo coordinates of the city. Overall, we have a communication with an external API (Google maps) and a hard dependency involved (autocomplete widget). A demo of how the component works could be seen <a href="http://krasimir.github.io/react-place/example/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how the component was done and why after finishing it it wasn&rsquo;t ready for publishing.</p>
<h2 id="toolset"><a name="user-content-toolset" href="#toolset" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Toolset</h2>
<p>There are few things which are at the top of the wave right now. One of them is React and its <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">JSX syntax</a>. Another one is the new ES6 spec and all these goodies that are landing in our browsers. I wanted to use them as soon as possible but because they are not well supported everywhere I needed a transpiler. Tool that will parse my ES6 code and will produce ES5 version. <a href="http://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> does the job and plays very well with React. Along with the transpiler I needed a bundler. Something that will resolve the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import">imports</a> and will generate only one file containing my application. My choice for that is <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-base"><a name="user-content-the-base" href="#the-base" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>The base</h2>
<p>Before a couple of weeks I created <a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-webpack-starter">react-webpack-started</a>. It gets JSX file as an input and using Babel generates ES5 file. We have a local dev server running, testing setup and a linter but that&rsquo;s another story (more about that <a href="http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/a-modern-react-starter-pack-based-on-webpack">here</a>).</p>
<p>Last half a year I like to use NPM as a place to define the project&rsquo;s build tasks. Here are the NPM scripts that I was able to run in the beginning:</p>
<p><pre><code>// in package.json
&quot;scripts&quot;: {
  &quot;dev&quot;: &quot;./node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch --inline&quot;,
  &quot;test&quot;: &quot;karma start&quot;,
  &quot;test:ci&quot;: &quot;watch 'npm run test' src/&quot;
}
</code></pre><br />
<code>npm run dev</code> fires the webpack compilation and the dev server. The testing is done with <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/">Karma runner</a> and Phantomjs. The directory structure that I used is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>|
+-- example-es6
|   +-- build
|   |   +-- app.js
|   |   +-- app.js.map
|   +-- src
|   |   +-- index.js
|   +-- index.html
+-- src
    +-- vendor
    |   +-- google.js
    + -- Location.jsx
</code></pre>

<p>The component that I want to publish is placed in <code>Location.jsx</code>. In order to test it I created a simple app (<code>example-es6</code> folder) that imports the file.</p>
<p>I spent some time developing the component and finally it was done. I pushed the changes to the <a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-place">repository</a> in GitHub and I thought that it is ready for distributing. Well, five minutes later I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t enough. Here is why:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I publish the component as a NPM package I&rsquo;ll need an entry point. Is my JSX file suitable for that? No, it&rsquo;s not because not every developer likes JSX. The component should be distributed in a non-JSX version.</li>
<li>My code is written in ES6. Not every developer uses ES6 and has a transpiler in its building process. So the entry point should be ES5 compatible.</li>
<li>The output of webpack indeed satisfies the two points above but it has one problem. What we have is a bundle. It contains the whole React library. We want to bundle the autocomplete widget but not React.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, webpack is useful while developing but can&rsquo;t generate a file that could be required or imported. I tried using the <a href="https://webpack.github.io/docs/library-and-externals.html">externals</a> option but that works if we have globally available dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="producing-es5-entry-point"><a name="user-content-producing-es5-entry-point" href="#producing-es5-entry-point" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Producing ES5 entry point</h2>
<p>So, defining a new NPM script made a lot of sense. NPM even <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts">has</a> a <code>prepublish</code> entry that runs before the package is published and local <code>npm install</code>. I continued with the following:</p>
<pre><code>// package.json
&quot;scripts&quot;: {
  &quot;prepublish&quot;: &quot;./node_modules/.bin/babel ./src --out-dir ./lib --source-maps --presets es2015,react&quot;
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>No webpack, just Babel. It gets everything from the <code>src</code> directory, converts the JSX to pure JavaScript calls and ES6 to ES5. The result is:</p>
<pre><code>|
+-- example-es6
+-- lib
|   +-- vendor
|   |   +-- google.js
|   |   +-- google.js.map
|   +-- Location.js
|   +-- Location.js.map
+-- src
    +-- vendor
    |   +-- google.js
    + -- Location.jsx
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>src</code> folder is translated to plain JavaScript plus source maps generated. An important role here plays the presets <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-es2015/"><code>es2015</code></a> and <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/"><code>react</code></a>.</p>
<p>In theory, from within a ES5 code we should be able to <code>require('Location.js')</code> and get the component working. However, when I opened the file I saw that there is no <code>module.exports</code>. Only</p>
<pre><code>exports.default = Location;

</code></pre>

<p>Which means that I had to require the library with</p>
<pre><code>require('Location').default;
</code></pre>

<p>Thankfully there is plugin <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-add-module-exports">babel-plugin-add-module-exports</a> that solves the issue. I changed the script to:</p>
<pre><code>./node_modules/.bin/babel ./src --out-dir ./lib 
--source-maps --presets es2015,react 
--plugins babel-plugin-add-module-exports
</code></pre>

<h2 id="generating-browser-bundle"><a name="user-content-generating-browser-bundle" href="#generating-browser-bundle" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Generating browser bundle</h2>
<p>The result of the previous section was a file which may be imported/required by any JavaScript project. Any bundling tool like webpack or <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> will resolve the needed dependencies. The last bit that I had to take care is the case where the developer doesn&rsquo;t use a bundler. Let&rsquo;s say that I want an already generated JavaScript file add it to my page with a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. I assume that React is already loaded on the page and I need only the component with its autocomplete widget included.</p>
<p>To achieve this I effectively used the file under the <code>lib</code> folder. I mentioned Browserify above so let&rsquo;s go with it:</p>
<pre><code>./node_modules/.bin/browserify ./lib/Location.js 
-o ./build/react-place.js 
--transform browserify-global-shim 
--standalone ReactPlace
</code></pre>

<p><code>-o</code> option is used to specify the output file. <code>--standalone</code> is needed because I don&rsquo;t have a module system and I need a global access to the component. The interesting bit is <code>--transform browserify-global-shim</code>. This is the transform plugin that excludes React but imports the autocomplete widget. To make it works I created a new entry in <code>package.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code>// package.json
&quot;browserify-global-shim&quot;: {
  &quot;react&quot;: &quot;React&quot;,
  &quot;react-dom&quot;: &quot;ReactDOM&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I specified the names of the global variables that will be resolve when I call <code>require('react')</code> and <code>require('react-dom')</code> from within the component. If we open the generated <code>build/react-place.js</code> file we will see:</p>
<pre><code>var _react = (window.React);
var _reactDom = (window.ReactDOM);
</code></pre>

<p>And when I talk about a component that is dropped as a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag then I think we need a minification. In production we should use a compressed version of the same <code>build/react-place.js</code> file. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js">Uglifyjs</a> is a nice module for minifying JavaScript. Just after the Browserify call:</p>
<pre><code>./node_modules/.bin/uglifyjs ./build/react-place.js 
--compress --mangle 
--output ./build/react-place.min.js 
--source-map ./build/react-place.min.js.map
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-result"><a name="user-content-the-result" href="#the-result" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>The result</h2>
<p>The final script is a combination of Babel, Browserify and Uglifyjs:</p>
<p><pre><code>// package.json
&quot;prepublish&quot;: &quot;
  ./node_modules/.bin/babel ./src --out-dir ./lib --source-maps --presets es2015,react --plugins babel-plugin-add-module-exports &amp;&amp; 
  ./node_modules/.bin/browserify ./lib/Location.js -o ./build/react-place.js --transform browserify-global-shim --standalone ReactPlace &amp;&amp; 
  ./node_modules/.bin/uglifyjs ./build/react-place.js --compress --mangle --output ./build/react-place.min.js --source-map ./build/react-place.min.js.map
&quot;,
</code></pre><br />
<em>(notice that I added few new lines to make the script readable here but in the <a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-place/blob/master/package.json#L25">original package.json</a> file everything is placed onto one line)</em></p>
<p>The final directories/files in the project look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>|
+-- build
|   +-- react-place.js
|   +-- react-place.min.js
|   +-- react-place.min.js.map
