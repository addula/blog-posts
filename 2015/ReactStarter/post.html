<p><i>Checkout React webpack starter in <a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-webpack-starter">GitHub</a>.</i></p>
<p>You know how crazy is the JavaScript world nowadays. There are new frameworks, libraries and tools coming every day. Frequently I’m exploring some of these goodies. I got a week long holiday. I promised to myself that I’ll not code, read or watch about code. Well, it’s stronger than me. <a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-webpack-starter">React werbpack starter</a> is the result of my no-programming week.</p>[STOP]
<p><a href="http://trialreach.com/">At work</a> we started using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and because <a href="https://webpack.github.io">webpack</a> is a hot topic I decided to create a startup kit. All the modules that we need for developing React applications bundled with webpack.</p>
<h2 id="npm-as-a-task-runner"><a name="user-content-npm-as-a-task-runner" href="#npm-as-a-task-runner" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>NPM as a task runner</h2>
<p>We’ll use webpack as a build tool but I prefer creating one layer on top of it. The <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts">npm scripts</a> are really nice way of defining tasks. The biggest benefit of doing this is that we may change the tool but keep the command. So all our deployment configuration stay untouched. Here is what we’ll end up with:</p>
<pre><code>"scripts": {
  "dev": "WEBPACK_ENV=dev ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch --inline",
  "build": "WEBPACK_ENV=build ./node_modules/.bin/webpack",
  "test": "karma start",
  "test:ci": "watch 'npm run test' src/"
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>npm run dev</code> will start webpack in <em>watch</em> mode. It will monitor for file changes and will rebuild everything. <code>--inline</code> is needed because of <a href="http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html">webpack-dev-server</a> which we will discuss shortly. <code>npm run build</code> does the same thing but only once. Notice that we set a <code>WEBPACK_ENV</code> variable. By doing this we pass parameters to webpack’s config file which will come handy during the building process. </p>
<p>The last two scripts are for our tests. They are based on <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/">Karma runner</a>.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-the-javascript"><a name="user-content-compiling-the-javascript" href="#compiling-the-javascript" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Compiling the JavaScript</h2>
<p>Back in the days we were only concatenating files. Nowadays, especially with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, we need more than that. Facebook’s library has its <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">jsx</a> syntax and we probably want writing JavaScript using ES6 features so it gets a little bit complicated.</p>
<p>webpack has <a href="https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html">loaders</a>. These are external modules that we use to preprocess our files. If we need something that is not included in webpack by default we use a loader. In our case we’ll add <a href="https://github.com/babel/babel-loader">babel-loader</a>. webpack similarly to Gulp and Grunt has a configuration file - <em>webpack.config.js</em>. Here is how ours starts:</p>
<pre><code>var webpack = require('webpack');

var appName = 'app';
var outputFile = appName + '.js';

var config = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  devtool: 'source-map',
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/lib',
    filename: outputFile,
    publicPath: __dirname + '/example'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /(\.jsx|\.js)$/,
        loader: 'babel',
        exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/
      }
    ]
  }
};

module.exports = config;
</code></pre>

<p>The source files which are written with ES6 syntax and may contain jsx are placed inside <code>src</code> directory. The output goes to <code>lib</code> directory as <code>app.js</code>. There is also source map generated - <code>lib/app.js.map</code> file.</p>
<p>If we run <code>npm run dev</code> in the console we will see:</p>
<p><img alt="react webpack starter" src="http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/articles/webpack-react-starter/a.png" /></p>
<p>The script is waiting for changes and every change in some of the files fires compilation.</p>
<h2 id="minification"><a name="user-content-minification" href="#minification" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Minification</h2>
<p>Let’s continue by creating a minified version of our bundle. That’s a must have part of our setup. Along with loaders webpack supports plugins too. Once of them is called <code>UglifyJsPlugin</code> and does exactly what we need:</p>
<pre><code>...
var UglifyJsPlugin = webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin;
var plugins = [];

plugins.push(new UglifyJsPlugin({ minimize: true }));

var config = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  devtool: 'source-map',
  output: ...,
  module: ...,
  plugins: plugins
};

module.exports = config;
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all nice but if we run <code>npm run dev</code> we’ll get <code>app.js</code> containing minified code. What we want is having <code>app.js</code> and <code>app.min.js</code> next to it. To achieve this we will use the <code>WEBPACK_ENV</code> variable that comes from the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>var UglifyJsPlugin = webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin;
var env = process.env.WEBPACK_ENV;

var appName = 'app';
var plugins = [], outputFile;

if (env === 'build') {
  plugins.push(new UglifyJsPlugin({ minimize: true }));
  outputFile = appName + '.min.js';
} else {
  outputFile = appName + '.js';
}

var config = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  devtool: 'source-map',
  output: {
    filename: outputFile,
    ...
  },
  module: ...,
  plugins: plugins
};

module.exports = config;
</code></pre>

<p>We get the value of <code>WEBPACK_ENV</code> and decide if webpack should produce a development version or production version. If we run <code>npm run build</code> we will get <code>app.min.js</code> and <code>app.min.js.map</code> generated. We still have <code>npm run dev</code> available while we work locally though.</p>
<h2 id="linting"><a name="user-content-linting" href="#linting" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Linting</h2>
<p>The most important part is done. We could write React components and everything is bundled. Let’s continue with linting our code. That is a process of analyzing that gives us warnings for potential errors. There are several tools for that and one of the most popular one is <a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>. There is <a href="https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader">eslint-loader</a> available:</p>
<pre><code>// in our webpack.config.js
...
module: {
  loaders: [
    {
      test: /(\.jsx|\.js)$/,
      loader: 'babel',
      exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/
    },
    {
      test: /(\.jsx|\.js)$/,
      loader: "eslint-loader",
      exclude: /node_modules/
    }
  ]
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>And we are done. If ESLint founds something will report it in our terminal. For example:</p>
<p><img alt="react webpack starter" src="http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/articles/webpack-react-starter/b.png" /></p>
<h2 id="running-a-local-web-server"><a name="user-content-running-a-local-web-server" href="#running-a-local-web-server" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Running a local web server</h2>
<p>webpack comes with <a href="http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html">webpack-dev-server</a>. Well, it is a separate dependency but it integrates very well. Here are the changes that we add to our <code>webpack.config.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code>...
var WebpackDevServer = require('webpack-dev-server');
var env = process.env.WEBPACK_ENV;

var host = '0.0.0.0';
var port = '9000';

var config = {
  ...
};

if (env === 'dev') {
  new WebpackDevServer(webpack(config), {
    contentBase: './example',
    hot: true,
    debug: true
  }).listen(port, host, function (err, result) {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  });
  console.log('-------------------------');
  console.log('Local web server runs at http://' + host + ':' + port);
  console.log('-------------------------');
}

module.exports = config;
</code></pre>

<p>We need the server running only in development mode so <code>WEBPACK_ENV</code> is used again. <code>contentBase</code> setting is defining the root of the server. That’s the directory where we have to place <code>index.html</code> file - the entry point of our application (checkout the <a href="https://github.com/krasimir/react-webpack-starter">repository in GitHub</a> for details). Once the server is up we have <a href="http://localhost:9000/">http://localhost:9000/</a> available and we may load that URL in our favorite browser.</p>
<h2 id="testing"><a name="user-content-testing" href="#testing" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Testing</h2>
<p>So far we did bundling, linting and running a local dev server. However, there is one bit missing - testing setup. I see that lots of starter packs do not contain such a thing. It is important to have it though and I’m sure that it takes to everyone.</p>
<p>webpack is a bundling tool. It is not a testing framework or task runner. So every try using it for running the tests is either complicated or doesn’t work well. That is why we will use <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/">Karma runner</a>. It makes possible running headless browsers or real ones from the terminal. It has its own <code>karma.conf.js</code> configuration file and here is how ours looks like:</p>
<pre><code>var webpackConfig = require('./webpack.config');
webpackConfig.devtool = 'inline-source-map';

module.exports = function (config) {
  config.set({
    browsers: [ 'PhantomJS' ],
    singleRun: true,
    frameworks: [ 'mocha', 'chai', 'sinon', 'sinon-chai' ],
    files: [
      'tests.webpack.js'
    ],
    plugins: [
      'karma-phantomjs-launcher',
      'karma-chai',
      'karma-mocha',
      'karma-sourcemap-loader',
      'karma-webpack',
      'karma-mocha-reporter',
      'karma-sinon',
      'karma-sinon-chai'
    ],
    preprocessors: {
      'tests.webpack.js': [ 'webpack', 'sourcemap' ]
    },
    reporters: [ 'mocha' ],
    webpack: webpackConfig,
    webpackServer: {
      noInfo: true
    },
    autoWatch: true
  });
};
</code></pre>

<p>Lot’s of stuff out there. Let’s go through the file and clarify what Karma needs.</p>
<p>We start by requiring the config file of webpack. That’s needed because we have to bundle our JavaScript before sending it to the browser. We need to overwrite <code>devtool</code> property so we make the source maps work. We choose PhantomJS as our browser and define all the frameworks that will be available globally in our scripts.</p>
<p>Because we are using loaders while producing our bundle we need to create a webpack <a href="https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/context">context</a> file. Karma takes this as a entry point.</p>
<pre><code>// tests.webpack.js
var context = require.context('./test', true, /.+\.spec\.jsx?$/);

require('core-js/es5');

context.keys().forEach(context);
module.exports = context;
</code></pre>

<p>The runner has its own reporter but Mocha’s one is (I think) better. Writing <code>reporters: [ 'mocha' ]</code> will make Karma display the results in a nicer way.</p>
<p>There are two modes of running Karma:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>npm run test</code> - the runner fires the tests only once and exists</li>
<li><code>npm run test:ci</code> - same as above but it continues listening for file changes</li>
</ul>
<p>The file monitoring is done via the <a href="https://github.com/mikeal/watch">watch module</a>.</p>
