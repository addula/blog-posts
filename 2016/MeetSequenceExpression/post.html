<p>You have no idea how fun is to transpiler JavaScript. I&rsquo;m digging into that last few weeks and there is a step where I have to transform an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> into valid code. There is one tree node which I really like - sequence expression.</p>[STOP]
<p>You are actually using sequence expression more often then you think. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>(4, 8);
</code></pre>

<p>The result of this line is <code>8</code>. We define different expressions which are evaluated from left to right. The result of the process is the result of the last one. In the example above that&rsquo;s just the number <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>The sequence expression could be helpful in lots of cases and it is useful when the expressions are related to each other. Let&rsquo;s check the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code>var from = 0;
var to = 10;
var skipIf = function (value) {
  return i === value ? (i = to, true) : false;
}
for(var i = from; skipIf(3), i &lt; to; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>
<pre><code>0
1
2
</code></pre>

<p>There are two sequence expressions. The first one is in the condition bit of the <code>for</code> loop. The second one is part of the <code>return</code> statement in <code>skipIf</code> function. The idea of the code is to break the loop after the third iteration /<em>For sure there are better ways to break a loop, but this example helps me illustrate the idea</em>/</p>
<p>In <code>skipIf(3), i&lt;to</code> we first run the function and then evaluate the condition. Both, the helper and the condition, are related to each other because the first one modifies a variable used in the second one. <code>skipIf</code> has two actions to perform if <code>i</code> matches the desire value. It should return <code>true</code> and it should stop the loop. <code>(i = to, true)</code> is doing exactly what we want. It changes <code>i</code> and returns the result of the second expression which is just <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>I started using sequence expression where I have to return a boolean based on some actions. For example:</p>
<pre><code>function validate(item) {
  if (42 === 42) {
    item.status = 'valid';
  }
  return item;
}
var item = { status: null };
var isReady = (item = validate(item), item.status === 'valid');

if (isReady) { // true
  // do something ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is another type of expression which is widely used and it is close to sequence expression - logical expression. It also evaluates its parts from left to right but there are different rules applied.</p>
<pre><code>var a = 'a';
var b = 'b';
(a &amp;&amp; b); // returns b
(a || b); // returns a

var a = 0;
var b = 'b';
(a &amp;&amp; b); // returns 0
(a || b); // returns b
</code></pre>

<p>When we use <code>&amp;&amp;</code> the engine starts evaluating the expressions till it finds one that has falsy result. With <code>||</code> the engine continues till it finds truthy expression.</p>
<pre><code>var a = 'a';
var b = 'b';
var c = 0;

(a &amp;&amp; c &amp;&amp; b); // returns 0
(c || a || b); // returns a
</code></pre>
