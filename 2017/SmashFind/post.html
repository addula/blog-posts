<p>I'm a proud father of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQM-f--AWn5/" target="_blank">two</a> and <a href="http://krasimirtsonev.com" target="_blank">programmer</a> for more then 15 years. My kids are small so I'm really into parenting right now. A bit of a problem for me is to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies in the Web. I really love my job but I just don't have enough time to look after all these frameworks, libraries or tools. I used to read Twitter, monitor RSS feeds and spend hours reading Reddit or Medium. However, no time for that anymore.</p>[STOP]

<p>For sure I needed something that will automate my learning processes.</p>

<h2>To aggregate or not</h2>

<p>Obviously I needed an aggregator. A tool that does all the stuff which I was doing when I had free time. But not just a collector of URLs. There are tons of those. I was interested in a specific set of resources and more importantly - the most popular among them. Links that other people find useful and they got shared again and again.</p>

<h2>SmashFind</h2>

<p><img style="max-width: 100px; display: block;  min-width: auto;border: solid 5px #000; padding: 1em; float: left; margin-right: 1em;" src="http://krasimirtsonev.com/v9/pics/upload/e93a06d0fed7507f685e2b5ec4da009d/logo.jpg" />Piece by piece for a couple of weeks I ended up with the first version of <a href="http://smashfind.com/" title="SmashFind">SmashFind</a>. It's a tool (bot + web app) that does all the stuff for me. It fetches tweets, understands RSS, reads subreddits, gets links from GitHub and a few other places. Having tons of URLs it goes to the social networks and checks how popular they are. Rank them and feeds a dashboard where I filter all the links. And by filter I mean that I delete those which are not technical. In the end they are published on SmashFind. As every developer that hacks something in his/her spare time I was really happy with the result. Well, at least for a couple of days :)</p>

<p>It was all good but having a list of 100+ links every day doesn't solve my problem. Indeed it's a list with really cool stuff but I still don't have time to read everything. Then using it on a daily basis I realized that I very often check just the first two or three paragraphs of the article and then I make a decision - read the whole page or not. It's enough to understand if the material is useful for me. So I implemented that too. Clicking on a link at <a href="http://smashfind.com/" title="SmashFind">SmashFind</a> presents all the collected information including the first ~600 chars and counted shares in the social networks. Of course sometimes those first paragraphs doesn't make a lot of sense. They may contain marketing information or just nothing but in most of the cases is exactly what I want.</p>

<p>And so far this is working really well for me. I spend like 30-40 mins per day with SmashFind. I stopped visiting places like Twitter (I'm lying) and Reddit simply because the most popular links from there are in SmashFind. And yes, I'm probably missing all these <i>cool</i> new frameworks and libraries. I'm probably missing the new React or the new Webpack. Well ... I'm completely fine with that.</p>

<h2>What's next</h2>

<p>I'm still in a process of fine-tuning the resources that the bot is querying. So if you know some cool people or places to follow do let me know. Drop me a line at <a href="mailto:hey@smashfind.com">hey@smashfind.com</a> or ping me in <a href="https://twitter.com/KrasimirTsonev" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
