# 8 Years of blogging

The [first article](http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/Creative-navigation-by-Hellomonday-com) on this blog is published on 22th of August 2008. It's about a website which I saw at [FWA](http://thefwa.com/). Eight years later I'm still publishing stuff here and because it is the beginning of a new year I decided to give you some statistics.

So far there are 1,308,099 unique users visited this blog. And most of those visits are in the last 3/4 years mainly because I'm writing "actively".

20% of the requests came from USA. India is on the second place:

![by country](http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/articles/8years/bycountry.jpg)

Bulgaria (the country where I live) is at 10th place with 2.31%.

I'm mainly writing technical articles so I guess it is normal to see Chrome (70%) and Firefox (18%) beating in the browsers' competition:

The range of 8 years is big and for that whole time *desktop* wins over *mobile*.

Most people came from google, second Reddit and Twitter.

Again United States is at the top of the list followed by India and United Kingdom. Chrome, Firefox and Safari take the first places in the browsers. IE has 1.17% share.

Google.com is missing in the first ten referrals. It's [echojs.com](http://www.echojs.com/) at the top:
