# Packt Publishing celebrates 10 years with a special $10 offer

It has been 10 years since [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/10years) embarked on its mission to deliver effective learning and information services to IT professionals. In that time, it has published over 2000 titles and helped projects become household names, awarding over $400,000 through its Open Source Project Royalty Scheme.

To celebrate this huge milestone, Packt is offering all of its eBooks and Videos at just $10 each – this promotion covers every title and customers can stock up on as many copies as they like until July 5th. 

As you already know, I have had my book - [Node.js Blueprints](http://www.packtpub.com/nodejs-blueprints/book), published in cooperation with Packt Publishing.
For those of you who have not gotten my book yet and are interested in doing so as an e-book, it’s only available for $10! The offer will not last for long.
