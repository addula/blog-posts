<p>I'm writing a lot of JavaScript these days. Even if the project is not Node.js based I'm using it for processing some tasks. At the moment most of my projects use <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">GruntJS</a>. Today I spend some time adding <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> to my workflow.</p>[STOP]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you know SASS is a Ruby based CSS preprocessor. So, the very first thing that you should do is to install Ruby on your system. It's like every other software - the installation depends on the  type of your operating system. Once you are done you have to install SASS. Go to your console and type:</p>
<pre><code>gem install sass
</code></pre>
<p>This will set up SASS. Let's additionally add <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> - CSS authoring framework build on top of SASS.</p>
<pre><code>gem install compass
</code></pre>
<p>And now we are ready to write our <i>Gruntfile.js</i>.</p>
<pre><code>module.exports = function(grunt) {

    grunt.initConfig({
        sass: {
            dist: {
                options: {
                    style: 'expanded'
                },
                files: {
                    'path/to/css/test.css': 'path/to/sass/test.scss'
                }
            }
        }
    });

    // loading modules
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-sass');

    grunt.registerTask('default', ['compass']);

}
</code></pre>
<p>There is a GruntJS plugin made specifically for the purpose. It's called <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass">grunt-contrib-sass</a> and you have to add it to your <i>package.json</i> file as a dependency. In the code above, we pointed out our main <i>test.scss</i> file and the destination of the compiled CSS.</p>
<p>My current project uses <a href="http://gumbyframework.com/">Gumby</a> framework, which is based on Compass. So, the above code will not work, because there are missing functionalities. We could change the script to:</p>
<pre><code>module.exports = function(grunt) {

    grunt.initConfig({
        compass: {
            dist: {
                options: {
                    raw: "\
                        require 'modular-scale'\n\
                        project_path = '.'\n\
                        preferred_syntax = :scss\n\
                        css_dir = './css'\n\
                        sass_dir = './sass'\n\
                        images_dir = './images'\n\
                        relative_assets = true\n\
                        line_comments = false\n\
                    "
                }
            }
        }
    });

    // loading modules
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-compass');

    grunt.registerTask('default', ['compass']);

}
</code></pre>
<p>And again there is a module which takes care about compilation via Compass - <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass">grunt-contrib-compass</a>. However that tool requires some configuration, which may be passed as property-value pairs into the <i>options</i> object. But in my case I had to add that <i>require 'modular-scale'</i> and I decided to use the <i>raw</i> property.</p>
